# Live Features
- Chat System ( Live )

# Monetizable
There are skins that users can purchase, the administrators can easily add new skins through the `assets.json`. Other than the skins, there is also the chat colors that users can purchase. All of this can be set through the `assets.json`. 

# Games
There are currently only one game that is playable however, i have made it so that you can add multiple games without having much of a headache. There is a spot on the top left which allows the players to switch between the games that are on the website

### Higher or Lower
Its a pretty basic game that i coded in, it just involves choosing between higher or lower. Betting against a bot, whichever option the user lands on gives out a payout. Since it's not a 50/50, the payout is slightly higher than something like a coinflip. The dice also gets animated when rolling and the user is able to change skins if needed.
